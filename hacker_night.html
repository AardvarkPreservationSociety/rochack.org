<h3>Let's do awesome things</h3>
<p>Hacker Nights are here to help you build whatever satisfies your curiosity. In the past, we've built things like <a href="http://rochack.org/rocbuses/">UR Bus Schedules</a>, the <a href="http://rochack.org/clustergraph/">Cluster Graph</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/RocHack/rochako">crazy IRC bots</a>.</p>

<h3>Or anything at all</h3>
<p>You don't need a crazy idea or project to join in. Come bring homework, programming questions, whatever. In addition to building cool things, these nights are all about building a community, and we'd love for as many people as possible to be a part of it.</p>

<h3>Not just for programmers</h3>
<p>All you need is the desire to build. If you don't know how to code, solder a circuit, or setup a server we'll find someone who can teach you.</p>

<h3>Try it out</h3>
<p>If any of this sounds good to you, come join the fun <b>every Monday night at 8pm</b> in <b>Hylan 301</b>.</p>
