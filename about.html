<h1>About RocHack</h1>
<p class="indent">
RocHack started with a Facebook thread about posting GitHub profiles. Shortly after, <a href="#">Simon Weber</a>, <a href="#">Sean Brennan</a>, <a href="#">Andrew Wong</a>, <a href="#">Charles Lehner</a>, and <a href="#">Steve Gattuso</a> met up in person for the very first RocHack meeting (which ended up being all of them sitting in a room ranting about technology) in September of 2012.

Since then, RocHack has grown and had events such as Hacker Nights and our first Hackathon in December 2013.
