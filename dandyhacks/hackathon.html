                    <p>University of Rochester's third 36 hour hackathon!</p>
                    <p> Hackathon! It's an event about building the coolest thing you can in 36 hours and meeting awesome people. This year we decided to try something new and combine CS and Data Science hackathon together! We don't place any restrictions on the kind of projects you can build. They can be software projects but we'd love to see hardware, or whatever else people come up with as well. It just has to be built within the 36 hours. </p>

                    <p> At the end of the 36 hours we have judges get together and determine the coolest hacks. Winners get awesome prizes! </p>

                            <p>Yep! Bring a laptop and anything else you need to get you into the coding zone. If you're from out of town and want to sleep make sure you bring a comfy sleeping bag!</p>
                            <p>If you're interested in a hardware hack, bring along some equipment but <b class="hax">we will have plenty of toys for you to use in your project</b> if you need anything!</p>

                            <p>No! The hackathon is completely free to all students who want to attend. The only thing you'll have to cover is transportation (if you're coming from other places) and some food.</p>

                            <p> Yes! You must be 18 years of age. We also follow <a href ="http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf" target="_blank"> MLH code of conduct</a>. Before signing up we will ask you to agree to it to be able to participate.</p>

                            <p>Yes! We're still working out the details but we'll at least cover one or two of your meals while you're hacking. Worst case, if you're still hungry, we are 3 minutes away from The Pit (our a-la-carte dining hall in Wilson Commons).</p>

                            <p>If you're interested in learning how to program, you should totally come. Hackathons are a great way to get started with building your awesome idea for yourself!
