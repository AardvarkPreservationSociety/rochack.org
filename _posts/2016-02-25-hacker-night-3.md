Thank you guys for voting on our Facebook poll! **iOS is our winner tonight!** (by a close margin).

We'll have a 10-15 minute demo of making a quick clone of the Uber interface, I think. Highlights include a Swift lang intro, Interface Builder, MapKit, and Xcode probably being uncooperative about a dozen times. Followed by a workshop, and then usual RocHack antics.
