Hello again everyone!

We're going to be kicking off Hacker Nights this semester with a session on
how to build a website in 30 minutes. We'll be teaching the basics of creating
structure with HTML, applying styles with CSS, and briefly showing how you can
use Javascript to make your webpages interactive. We'll also have a quick demo
of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), a HTML/CSS/JS framework that allows
developers to quickly prototype websites. 

After the talk we'll leave the rest of the night to hang out, get to know each
other, and hack/learn together. Most importantly, we'll also have snacks to 
keep everyone from getting hangry.

We're really excited to get things started on a high note this semester, so
we'd love for you (and your friends!) to show up and learn/hang out with us **this Thursday (2/11/16) at 8pm in Hylan 301**.
