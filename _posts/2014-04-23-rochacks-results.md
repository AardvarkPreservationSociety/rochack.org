We're happy to report that RocHacks was a huge success! We had over 40 students attend our first ever 24 hour hackathon and we couldn't have been happier with the results.

Congratulations to the three grand prize winners (there was a tie for first): Emily Eisenberg (Rochester '15) for her mini [operating system](https://github.com/xymostech/RockHackOS) and the team of Charles Lehner (Rochester '15) and Nate Book (Rochester '14) for their distributed IRC system, [meshchat](https://github.com/RocHack/meshchat).

We also had some awesome runner ups building hacks like a video-based step sequencer, an LED staircase (which is still in process) and a [Reddit notifier for chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-notifier/ikingdipinldcfllekffnlgbojbbpilk?hl=en).

We'd like to thank everyone for coming out and being a part of our first hackathon. We hope you had as much fun hacking as we had organizing the event for you. We'd also like to thank our fantastic sponsors for making this event possible:

We're looking forward to hosting a (hopefully even bigger) RocHacks next Spring. Hopefully we'll see you all there!
