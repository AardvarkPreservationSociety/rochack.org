Hi everybody!

After a bit of hiatus from last semester due to hectic schedules (sorry about
that) we're incredibly happy to announce that we're back in action this
semester. We're going to kick off the new season with an improved edition of
Hacker Nights.  

For those of you who are new to the scene, Hacker Nights are a weekly event
hosted by RocHack dedicated to bridging what you're doing in class with what's
actually going on in the outside tech industry. A few highlights of what we're
planning include:

* An introduction to `git`, the ubiquitous version control system used in
  probably any CS job you'll find
* How to build your first website (starting out with HTML/CSS and Javascript)
* Making web apps (TBD between Rails or React)
* Talks from professors. In the past we've had Prof. Ding talk about the
  concepts of Object Oriented Programming with Ruby and Prof. Guo discuss his
  Python tutor research.
* How to navigate the tech industry and land an internship

In addition we're planning on having social events to help foster a strong
community of hackers at U of R.

We're really excited about what's to come this semester and hope you'll join us
at our first Hacker Night (date/time will come soon)!<br />
