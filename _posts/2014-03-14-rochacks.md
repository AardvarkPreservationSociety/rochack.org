Hey everyone, 

We&#39;re proud to finally announce the Spring 2014 RocHack Hackathon! We looked at all of the suggestions and feedback we got from the Fall hackathon and used it to make sure this hackathon will be even better!

This time around we&#39;re going to be taking up the entire first floor of the new Rettner Building (no more crammed CSB 209). We&#39;ve also arranged for this to be our first **24 hour hackathon**, so you&#39;ll have 3x more time to make your hacks even better. Finally, we made sure that this hackathon would be **open to all schools**, so spread the word to friends at other universities!

There&#39;s plenty more awesome to be had, so check out the <a href="/hackathon.html">hackathonpage</a> for more details.
